// 3E+ segments are pre associated to banks :
// RAM or ROM Bank0 is mapped at 0x1c00
// RAM or ROM Bank1 is mapped at 0x1800
// RAM or ROM Bank2 is mapped at 0x1400
// RAM or ROM Bank3 is mapped at 0x1000
// RAM or ROM Bank4 is mapped at 0x1c00
// etc.

// Rule 1 :Never select a RAM bank which has the same segment as the current executing ROM bank !
// Rul√© 2: RAM bank selection is manual. Use select_ram macro
